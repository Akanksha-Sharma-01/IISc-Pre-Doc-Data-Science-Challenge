# IISc-Pre-Doc-Data-Science-Challenge
This repository contains my work in Data Science Challenge for Pre-Doc admission in IISc, Banglore. The challenge contains following challenge:

1.Visualize the relation between features (you can design your own new features based on the given data)

2.Develop an ML model which, given the name of a director, predicts the release year of his next movie along with its probable genres

I have approached the task by implementing two different models, one for each task.
